The [Carboniferous period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboniferous) was a fascinating era for life on Earth. It began about 360 million years ago when plants first evolved the ability to form wood, and ended 60 million years later when the first fungi evolved the ability to consume it. During that period, the newly evolved trees began to massively out-compete their rivals, and spread across the globe. For 60 million years these trees would grow, and die, and litter the ground with massive stacks of dead trees, which were unable to decompose due to the lack of organisms that could digest them.

As the trees piled up, absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere, the oxygen on Earth soared to as high as 35% (compared to 21% today) which led to the evolution of larger and larger creatures that could take advantage of the energy provided by all of the extra oxygen.

In the modern era, most major coal deposits were formed by these same stacks of trees, compressed over the course of hundreds of millions of years until humans dug up the coal and started using it as fuel. We are now in a situation where all of this CO2 is, once again, being released into Earth's atmosphere. To keep our planet habitable, there is no doubt that we will need to begin sequestering carbon at an unprecedented rate. 

### A New Era of Carbon Sequestration

Many amazing projects are currently underway in the effort to scale up carbon sequestration, but one intriguing option is often overlooked. **Large scale sustainable farming and processing of lumber for use exclusively in long term construction projects.** Recently, there has been some amazing work in using specially processed lumber for building massive structures, including [skyscrapers](https://www.euronews.com/2018/05/04/get-used-to-wooden-skyscrapers-they-are-stronger-cleaner-and-fire-resistant-view). Utilizing next generation construction technologies, like [Cross-laminated timber (CLT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-laminated_timber) we can build massive structures out of wood, which could stand for hundreds or thousands of years. By sequestering atmospheric carbon as permanent building materials, we can begin to reverse the damage caused by generations of coal burning, while supplying the world with sustainable and plentiful building material. This has the added benefit of reducing our reliance on cement, a major contributor of greenhouse emissions.

### Phase One : Getting the word out

Welcome to phase one of Carboniferous. Please provide feedback via Twitter to @deanpierce, or via github issues or pull requests.

### Phase Two : Funding

Many funding options for this project are being considered, mostly revolving crypto-incentive mechanisms, such as the governance tokens used by projects like GitCoin, which has incentivized the funding of over 50 million dollars to various open source software projects doing good things in the space.

### Phase Three : Doing

Early phases will include buying up logging rights, and setting up a research facility for testing experimental logging equipment, and an experimental sawmill to prove out sustainability of various components of the wood economy. Ultimately the goal will be to create a certification process and set of standards which will enable the wood industry to take full advantage of the carbon tax credits, and providing the required resources to the industry to maximize their impact of carbon sequestration.
